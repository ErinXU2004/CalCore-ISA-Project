# CalCore-ISA 🍱⚙️

**CalCore-ISA** is a domain-specific instruction set architecture (ISA) for compiling lifestyle goals, especially for weight loss, into structured, programmable behavior scripts.

Instead of manually logging every meal or workout, CalCore lets users write high-level goals in a readable DSL (domain-specific language) and then simulates how daily behaviors affect calorie balance and health outcomes.

Designed by **Erin Xu**, a computer engineer and dancer who believes life should be structured *and* delicious.
